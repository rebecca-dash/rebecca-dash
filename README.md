- 👋 Hi, I’m @rebecca-dash
- 👀 I’m interested in building my skills for scalable solutions
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Assembly Language for Linux, hardware design, and Google Cloud! Much more to do though!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding projects that enhance creativity and tool learning. 
- My passions are in finance. I did a coding bootcamp 
- with UC Berkely where I learned how to build financial applications and blockchain tech such as Solidity. 
- I thoroughly enjoy product development and product management.
- I am developing a cybersecurity game in VR to teach basic concepts to other students in a fun way. This project will use an AI model that generates an opposing player that the human player will need to infiltrate under a constrained time limit.
- Another project I am developing utilizes AI/ML to create mock tests for students. Concentrating on physics and mathematics for the demo product, each mock test is generated from a chat interface and correlates with a professor's particular teaching and testing style.
