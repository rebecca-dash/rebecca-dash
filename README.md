- 👋 Hi, I’m @rebecca-dash
- 👀 I’m interested in building my skils for scalable solutions
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Assembly Language for Linux, hardware design, and Google Cloud! Much more to do though!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding projects that enhance creativity and tool learning. 
- My passions are in the arts and entertainment industry but I also love real estate and finance. I did a coding bootcamp 
- with UC Berkely where I learned how to build financial applications and blockchain tech such as Solidity. 
- I thoroughly enjoy the product development
- and creative process of putting something into the market! 10/10 I really hope to design again!
